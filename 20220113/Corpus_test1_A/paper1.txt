A Premier League footballer was on board a light aircraft that disappeared over the English Channel last night, French police have confirmed.

Emergency responders launched a search and rescue operation at about 8.30pm after the plane carrying Emiliano Sala, Cardiff City's record new signing, went off the radar. The pilot is understood to have been the only other person on the flight.

Sala, 28, from Argentina, posted on his Twitter account that he had travelled back to Nantes in northwestern France to say goodbye to his former team-mates, and was returning to the UK.

"La ultima ciao", said his tweet accompanying a photograph of him with team-mates at the French first division club where he played for four years and scored 42 goals.
