he footballer Emiliano Sala, who is feared dead after a light aircraft disappeared off the Channel Island of Alderney, was widely expected to become a key player in the Premier League in the coming months after establishing himself this season as one of the best goalscorers in Europe.

Sala, 28, a tall, rangy Argentinian with a penchant for headed goals and close-range finishes, had scored 12 goals for Nantes this season in Ligue 1, the French top flight, behind only the vaunted Paris Saint-Germain trio of Kylian Mbappe, Edison Cavani and Neymar, and Nicolas Pepe of Lille.

His signing, for a club-record fee of about 15 million pounds, was considered a genuine coup for Cardiff, who had been monitoring the player for some time.
