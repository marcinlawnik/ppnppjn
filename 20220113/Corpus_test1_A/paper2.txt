The government may be in chaos and the country facing an uncertain political and economic future. Yet being a neighbour to the Queen still commands an eyewatering price tag for the global super-rich - even with a 34 per cent discount.

One of the world's most powerful businessmen has overlooked the challenges of Brexit to invest nearly 100 million pounds in a property near Buckingham Palace. Ken Griffin, a billionaire hedge fund tycoon, confirmed yesterday that he had bought 3 Carlton Gardens, a Georgian house overlooking St James's Park, completing the most expensive property sale in Britain since 2011.
