Task 1

I am wondering about a word chairman at least 6 times. Can a woman be a Chairman? Maybe it is better to say a chairperson? Chairrrrrmannnn!!! Does it sound very masculine? Even if I say this 1000 times for me it is neutral. I would say charman may also be a woman. And what do you think about the word 'chaiman'?
